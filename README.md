# Function-Grapher
A Java standalone application that graphs 2D mathematical functions

This Java application parses 2D mathematical functions and plots their graphs. It uses a simple stack based parser and repeatedly evaluates the function at regular steps. The plotting is handled using JFreeChart, allowing dynamic zooming into selected rectangles on the graph.
